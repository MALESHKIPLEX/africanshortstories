Yiyun Li’s enchanting story about a
Chinese American nanny caring for a
troubled mother and her newborn is
the winner of the Sunday Times Short
Story prize for 2015 . Her elegant prose
is a revelation. I must confess that I
read this story at least half a dozen
times.
Auntie Mei had worked as a live-in
nanny for newborns and their mothers
for eleven years. As a rule, she moved
out of the family’s house the day a
baby turned a month old, unless—
though this rarely happened—she was
between jobs, which was never more
than a few days. Many families would
have been glad to pay her extra for
another week, or another month;
some even offered a longer term, but
Auntie Mei always declined: she
worked as a first-month nanny, whose
duties, toward both the mother and
the infant, were different from those of
a regular nanny. Once in a while, she
was approached by previous
employers to care for their second
child. The thought of facing a child
who had once been an infant in her
arms led to lost sleep; she agreed only
when there was no other option, and
she treated the older children as
though they were empty air. </p>
