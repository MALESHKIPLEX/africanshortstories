Alice Munro tells the story of a
woman who visits her father, who is
not keeping too well, and her
stepmother in an old farmhouse:
This is an old school bus, with very
uncomfortable seats which cannot be
adjusted in any way, and windows cut
by horizontal metal frames. That
makes it necessary to slump down or
to sit up very straight and crane your
neck, in order to get an unobstructed
view—I find this irritating, because the
countryside here is what I most want
to see—the reddening fall woods and
the dry fields of stubble and the cows
crowding the barn porches. Such
unremarkable scenes, in this part of
the country, are what I have always
thought would be the last thing I
would care to see in my life.

        <H>Assimilation”</H>
        <p>
            The New Yorker, 2010)
E. L. Doctorow passed away last year
at the age of 84. In this story, Ramon,
who works as a dishwasher in
Borislav’s restaurant, agrees to marry Borislav’s niece Jelena for a sum of
$3,000. The deal is that he will remain
married till Jelena gets her green card
and then divorce her, two years after
the marriage. With the money, he will
be paying for a film school.
Some sort of city functionary married
them. He mumbled and his eyes
widened as if he were having trouble
focussing. He was drunk. When the
photographer’s flash went off behind
him he lost his place in his book and
had to start again. He swayed, and
nearly knocked over the lectern. He
clearly didn’t understand the situation
because when he pronounced them
man and wife he urged them to kiss.
The girl laughed as she turned away
and ran to the heavyset fellow and
kissed him.
The photographer placed a bouquet of
flowers in the girl’s arms and posed
her with Ramon for the formal
wedding picture. And that was that.
Ramon was dropped off at the hotel
and the next day he flew home.

        <H1> in hindsight</H1>
        <p>Callan Wink’s In Hindsight is a novella,
the first to be published in The New
Yorker’s online-only feature, New
Yorker Novella. I hope they make it a
regular feature. Read the opening
passage of this fascinating, brutal
story set in the dusty, barren land
where Lauren lives with her cattle,
hogs, cats and dogs while doing a day
job at the local high school.
Lauren followed the drag mark for a
mile down the gravel road and then
another half mile down her dusty
driveway and then parked her truck
and cried. The bastard had shot one of
her steers—one of six, red Texas
longhorns—and dragged it down the
road by its neck and deposited it here
for her to find, practicall

        <H1>what happened to the Baby</H1>
        <p> Ozick’s story about Vivian and her
family’s relationship with her crazy
uncle Simon, aunt Essie and their
daughter Henrietta, who died when
she was eleven months old.
Uncle Simon was not really my uncle.
He was my mother’s first cousin, butout of respect, and because he
belonged to an older generation, I was
made to call him uncle. My mother
revered him. “Uncle Simon,” she said,
“is the smartest man you’ll ever
know.” He was an inventor, though
not of mundane things like machines,
and he had founded the League for a
Unified Humanity. What Uncle Simon
had invented—and was apparently
still inventing, since it was by nature
an infinite task—was a wholly new
language, one that could be spoken
and understood by everyone alive. He
had named it GNU, after the African
antelope that sports two curved horns,
each one turned toward the other, as
if striving to close a circle.</p>
        
        <H1>a ride out of phrao</H1>
        <p> (Dina
Nayeri, Alaska Quarterly Review /
LitHub)
Dina Nayeri’s story about a middle-
aged Iranian doctor, who had moved
to America, relocating to work for the
Peace Corps in a remote Thai village,
and her Americanised daughter who
comes visiting. This gem of a story
was an O. Henry Prize winner in 2015.
On the morning she begins her job at
the local school, a hot rain soaks the village and she glimpses her neighbors
eating a wordless morning meal on
the floor. Their window is barely three
feet from hers, so that she can
examine their food, hear some of their
whispers, breathe in the sharp scent of
their incense. The rain blurs the lines
of their faces and bodies, and their
movements become dreamlike. They
remind her of her parents, the way
they broke fast quietly, always on the
floor, and as a teenager she often gave
them fifteen minutes before she joined
with her cup of tea.

        <H1> healthy start</H1>
        <p> House, 2006)
I absolutely adore anything written by
Etgar Keret and post his stories as
soon as I can find one.
At the café they always gave him a
table set for two, and sat him across
from an empty chair. Always. Even
when the waiter specifically asked him
whether he was alone. Other people
would be sitting there in twos or
threes, laughing or tasting each
other’s food, or fighting over the bill,
while Avichai sat by himself eating his
Healthy Start—orange juice, muesliwith honey, decaf double espresso with
warm low-fat milk on the side. Of
course it would have been nicer if
someone had sat down across from
him and laughed with him, if there
had been someone to argue with over
the bill and he’d have to struggle, to
hand the money to the waitress
saying, “Don’t take it from him!
Mickey, stop. Just stop! This one’s on
me.” But he didn’t really have anyone
to do that with, and breakfast alone
was ten times better than staying
home.

        <h1>proffession bartending</h1>
        <p> Without Borders, 2004)
If you are going to read just one story
from the list then let it be this one.
After reading the story I immediately
bought Ryu Murakami’s In the Miso
Soup. This other Murakami also lives
in Japan and is a best-selling author
in his own right. Audition , on which the
famed film is based, is one of his bestknown books.
The bartender never rests. He lines up
the glasses, chills the champagne and
white wine, chips rocks out of a block
of ice, replaces ashtrays, serves up
platters of sausages or raw oysters.
No doubt all nine of the people sitting
at this bar are looking for sin tonight.
The circumstances are different for
each, of course, but all have the same
destination in mind. No one gets
drunk in order to elevate their moral
standards. The bartender, sure
enough, is a priest of sorts.

        <p> (Raymond Carver,
Granta, 2004)
Everything he writes in his graceful,
precise prose is immensely readable.
Here’s a lovely story by the man
responsible for revitalising the short
story in the 80s.
My Patti was a beauty. Donna and
Sheila were medium-pretty. One night
Sheila confessed to Patti that she loved
her more than anything on earth.
Patti told me she used those words.
Patti had driven her home and they
were sitting in front of Sheila’sapartment. Patti said she loved her
too. She loved all her friends. But not
in the way Sheila had in mind. Then
Sheila touched Patti’s breast. She
brushed the nipple through Patti’s
blouse. Patti took Sheila’s hand and
held it. She told her she didn’t swing
that way. Sheila didn’t bat an eye.
After a minute, she nodded. But she
kept Patti’s hand. She kissed it, then
got out of the car.

        <H1> you dont miss your water</H1>
        <p>the Well Dries)” (T. Coraghessan
Boyle, Narrative Magazine, 2015)
T.C. Boyle’s lovely story about a
couple during the long drought in a
southwestern state. I loved his short
story “The Lie,” which I posted earlier
as well. Time to order The Harder They
Come.
Still, as much as I loved my wife and
enjoyed seeing her au naturel, two in a
tub was a crowd, and I’m sure she
must have felt the same, though she
never said as much. She was a good
sport, Micki, and if my knees were in
the way and the water felt faintly
greasy, she made the most of it, but
for me the weekly bath began to feellike a burden. “Remember the old
days?” I’d say, soaping her back or
kneading the shampoo into the long
dark ropes of her hair. “You know,
when you could just get up with the
alarm and step into the shower before
work?” And she would nod wistfully,
the water sloshing at her armpits and
the tender gaps behind her knees,
before heaving herself out of the tub to
snatch up her thrice-used towel.

        <H1> a sheltered woman</H1>
        <p>The New Yorker, 2014)
Yiyun Li’s enchanting story about a
Chinese American nanny caring for a
troubled mother and her newborn is
the winner of the Sunday Times Short
Story prize for 2015 . Her elegant prose
is a revelation. I must confess that I
read this story at least half a dozen
times.
Auntie Mei had worked as a live-in
nanny for newborns and their mothers
for eleven years. As a rule, she moved
out of the family’s house the day a
baby turned a month old, unless—
though this rarely happened—she was
between jobs, which was never more
than a few days. Many families would
have been glad to pay her extra for
another week, or another month;
some even offered a longer term, but
Auntie Mei always declined: she
worked as a first-month nanny, whose
duties, toward both the mother and
the infant, were different from those of
a regular nanny. Once in a while, she
was approached by previous
employers to care for their second
child. The thought of facing a child
who had once been an infant in her
arms led to lost sleep; she agreed only
when there was no other option, and
she treated the older children as
though they were empty air. </p>
