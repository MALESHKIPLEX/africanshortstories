    <P>The Pokot belong to the Kalenjin group consisting of diverse groups of people who share Nilo-Hamitic ancestry and history. They live in west Pokot and Baringo counties of Kenya and in eastern Karmojong. The nomadic life of the Pokot brought them into contact other peoples throughout their history. These interactions have enabled then intermarry with other communities, also enrich their social customs. They borrowed many customs from their Turkana and Karamojong neighbours.

In the 1890s, drought, rinderpest, and famines destroyed herds of cattle and destabilized human populations in West Pokot and throughout eastern and southern African plains. Karamojong and Tukana herds were especially decimated. This was followed by smallpox swept through East Africa beginning in 1899.

All of the pastoralists on the plains were diminished in numbers and stock. However, those Pokot who lived on the mountains managed to survive in greater numbers, and many began to migrate to the plains.

The new colonial government also helped to make Pokot expansion possible.

The Pokot were forced to move into areas that were previously occupied by the Karamojong. In the meantime, they lost grazing grounds to the Turkana, who were pushing down from the north and the west. As the more powerful Turkana expanded, the Pokot communities retreated further south to the Cherengeni and adjacent volcanic hills, plateaus and plains in north-western Kenya, where they began to supplement their diet by farming. To outsiders, they retained a ferocious reputation, and Swahili traders in the 1860s reportedly refused to enter Pokot lands for fear of terminated.

In 1910, the British administration alienated the southern grazing land of the Pokot for European farms. West Pokot became a ‘closed’ district, a buffer zone so to speak, between the northernmost reaches of the ‘White highlands’ and the shifting frontiers of Turkana. This was the situation throughout the colonial. So that except for a few colonial civil servants and missionaries few people ventured into the Pokot land. In 1931, the protestant London-based Bible Churchmen’s Missionary Society opened a station the area. And in 1942 the Irish Catholic Kiltegan Fathers started a school for catechumens in 1942. The Catholic Church opened the first hospital in the district in 1956 under the care of the Irish nuns of the of the order of the Holy Rosary Sisters.  Around this time, a religious movement calling itself the “Dini ya Yomöt” sought to drive Europeans out of the region.

West Pokot is one the least developed district as a result of the social and political-economic isolation of district during the colonial period. As other regions in Kenya and Uganda were being modernized, gaining new schools, hospitals, roads, the Pokot were left behind and marginalized. From 1913 to 1964, West Pokot was isolated as a ‘closed district’ and investment in the area was minimal.

Cows are used for barter, exchange, and most significantly as a form of bride wealth. A man is permitted to marry more than one woman, as long as he has sufficient number of cows to offer to her family in exchange. This is the primary way for wealth and resources to change hands in Pokot society. Wealth is measured by the number of cows one owns.

Cows are rarely slaughtered for meat because they are much more valuable alive. They provide milk, butter, and cheese, which provide an important component of Pokot dietary needs.

Government and missionary sponsored projects for economic and social betterment of people expanded World War II. The projects focused on soil conservation, education, and health care. Infrastructure and transport, commercial centres, and land adjudication dates from the 1970s, also the expansion of basic education, health-care services, religious denominations, and government involvement in the organization of women’s cooperatives.</P>
