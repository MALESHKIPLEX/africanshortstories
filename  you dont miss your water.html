    <p>the Well Dries)” (T. Coraghessan
Boyle, Narrative Magazine, 2015)
T.C. Boyle’s lovely story about a
couple during the long drought in a
southwestern state. I loved his short
story “The Lie,” which I posted earlier
as well. Time to order The Harder They
Come.
Still, as much as I loved my wife and
enjoyed seeing her au naturel, two in a
tub was a crowd, and I’m sure she
must have felt the same, though she
never said as much. She was a good
sport, Micki, and if my knees were in
the way and the water felt faintly
greasy, she made the most of it, but
for me the weekly bath began to feellike a burden. “Remember the old
days?” I’d say, soaping her back or
kneading the shampoo into the long
dark ropes of her hair. “You know,
when you could just get up with the
alarm and step into the shower before
work?” And she would nod wistfully,
the water sloshing at her armpits and
the tender gaps behind her knees,
before heaving herself out of the tub to
snatch up her thrice-used towel.
