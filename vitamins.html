    <p> (Raymond Carver,
Granta, 2004)
Everything he writes in his graceful,
precise prose is immensely readable.
Here’s a lovely story by the man
responsible for revitalising the short
story in the 80s.
My Patti was a beauty. Donna and
Sheila were medium-pretty. One night
Sheila confessed to Patti that she loved
her more than anything on earth.
Patti told me she used those words.
Patti had driven her home and they
were sitting in front of Sheila’sapartment. Patti said she loved her
too. She loved all her friends. But not
in the way Sheila had in mind. Then
Sheila touched Patti’s breast. She
brushed the nipple through Patti’s
blouse. Patti took Sheila’s hand and
held it. She told her she didn’t swing
that way. Sheila didn’t bat an eye.
After a minute, she nodded. But she
kept Patti’s hand. She kissed it, then
got out of the car.
