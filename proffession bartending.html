    <h1>proffessional bartending</h1>
    <p> Without Borders, 2004)
If you are going to read just one story
from the list then let it be this one.
After reading the story I immediately
bought Ryu Murakamiâ€™s In the Miso
Soup. This other Murakami also lives
in Japan and is a best-selling author
in his own right. Audition , on which the
famed film is based, is one of his bestknown books.
The bartender never rests. He lines up
the glasses, chills the champagne and
white wine, chips rocks out of a block
of ice, replaces ashtrays, serves up
platters of sausages or raw oysters.
No doubt all nine of the people sitting
at this bar are looking for sin tonight.
The circumstances are different for
each, of course, but all have the same
destination in mind. No one gets
drunk in order to elevate their moral
standards. The bartender, sure
enough, is a priest of sorts.
