    <p> Ozick’s story about Vivian and her
family’s relationship with her crazy
uncle Simon, aunt Essie and their
daughter Henrietta, who died when
she was eleven months old.
Uncle Simon was not really my uncle.
He was my mother’s first cousin, butout of respect, and because he
belonged to an older generation, I was
made to call him uncle. My mother
revered him. “Uncle Simon,” she said,
“is the smartest man you’ll ever
know.” He was an inventor, though
not of mundane things like machines,
and he had founded the League for a
Unified Humanity. What Uncle Simon
had invented—and was apparently
still inventing, since it was by nature
an infinite task—was a wholly new
language, one that could be spoken
and understood by everyone alive. He
had named it GNU, after the African
antelope that sports two curved horns,
each one turned toward the other, as
if striving to close a circle.</p>
