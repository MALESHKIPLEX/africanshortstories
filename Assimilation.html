    <p>The New Yorker, 2010)
E. L. Doctorow passed away last year
at the age of 84. In this story, Ramon,
who works as a dishwasher in
Borislav’s restaurant, agrees to marry Borislav’s niece Jelena for a sum of
$3,000. The deal is that he will remain
married till Jelena gets her green card
and then divorce her, two years after
the marriage. With the money, he will
be paying for a film school.
Some sort of city functionary married
them. He mumbled and his eyes
widened as if he were having trouble
focussing. He was drunk. When the
photographer’s flash went off behind
him he lost his place in his book and
had to start again. He swayed, and
nearly knocked over the lectern. He
clearly didn’t understand the situation
because when he pronounced them
man and wife he urged them to kiss.
The girl laughed as she turned away
and ran to the heavyset fellow and
kissed him.
The photographer placed a bouquet of
flowers in the girl’s arms and posed
her with Ramon for the formal
wedding picture. And that was that.
Ramon was dropped off at the hotel
and the next day he flew home.</p>
