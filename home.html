Alice Munro tells the story of a
woman who visits her father, who is
not keeping too well, and her
stepmother in an old farmhouse:
This is an old school bus, with very
uncomfortable seats which cannot be
adjusted in any way, and windows cut
by horizontal metal frames. That
makes it necessary to slump down or
to sit up very straight and crane your
neck, in order to get an unobstructed
view—I find this irritating, because the
countryside here is what I most want
to see—the reddening fall woods and
the dry fields of stubble and the cows
crowding the barn porches. Such
unremarkable scenes, in this part of
the country, are what I have always
thought would be the last thing I
would care to see in my life. </p>
