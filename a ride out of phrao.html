    <h1>a ride out of phrao</h1>
    <p> (Dina
Nayeri, Alaska Quarterly Review /
LitHub)
Dina Nayeriâ€™s story about a middle-
aged Iranian doctor, who had moved
to America, relocating to work for the
Peace Corps in a remote Thai village,
and her Americanised daughter who
comes visiting. This gem of a story
was an O. Henry Prize winner in 2015.
On the morning she begins her job at
the local school, a hot rain soaks the village and she glimpses her neighbors
eating a wordless morning meal on
the floor. Their window is barely three
feet from hers, so that she can
examine their food, hear some of their
whispers, breathe in the sharp scent of
their incense. The rain blurs the lines
of their faces and bodies, and their
movements become dreamlike. They
remind her of her parents, the way
they broke fast quietly, always on the
floor, and as a teenager she often gave
them fifteen minutes before she joined
with her cup of tea.
