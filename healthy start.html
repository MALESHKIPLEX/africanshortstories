I absolutely adore anything written by
Etgar Keret and post his stories as
soon as I can find one.
At the café they always gave him a
table set for two, and sat him across
from an empty chair. Always. Even
when the waiter specifically asked him
whether he was alone. Other people
would be sitting there in twos or
threes, laughing or tasting each
other’s food, or fighting over the bill,
while Avichai sat by himself eating his
Healthy Start—orange juice, muesliwith honey, decaf double espresso with
warm low-fat milk on the side. Of
course it would have been nicer if
someone had sat down across from
him and laughed with him, if there
had been someone to argue with over
the bill and he’d have to struggle, to
hand the money to the waitress
saying, “Don’t take it from him!
Mickey, stop. Just stop! This one’s on
me.” But he didn’t really have anyone
to do that with, and breakfast alone
was ten times better than staying
home.
